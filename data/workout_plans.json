However, I should clarify that while I can provide general advice on exercise, I'm not an expert in fitness or workout planning. Here's a basic plan that you might find useful:\n\n**Warm-up (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Light jogging in place - 3 minutes\n2. Jumping jacks - 2 minutes\n3. Arm circles (both directions) - 2 minutes\n4. Dynamic stretches for the chest - 3 minutes\n\n**Main Exercises (30 minutes)**\n\n1. **Dumbbell Bench Press** - 3 sets of 10 reps\n   - Rest for 1-2 minutes between sets\n   - This exercise targets the middle and lower chest muscles\n\n2. **Dumbbell Incline Bench Press** - 3 sets of 10 reps\n   - Rest for 1-2 minutes between sets\n   - This exercise targets the upper chest muscles\n\n3. **Dumbbell Flyes** - 3 sets of 10 reps\n   - Rest for 1-2 minutes between sets\n   - This exercise targets the outer chest muscles\n\n4. **Dumbbell Pullover** - 3 sets of 10 reps\n   - Rest for 1-2 minutes between sets\n   - This exercise targets the lower chest and the lats\n\n5. **Push-ups** - 3 sets of 10 reps\n   - Rest for 1-2 minutes between sets\n   - This exercise is a great finisher and it targets the whole chest\n\n**Cool-down (5 minutes)**\n\n1. Static stretches for the chest - hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds\n\nRemember, muscle gain is not just about the workout. It's also about nutrition and rest. Make sure you're eating enough protein and calories to support muscle growth, and getting enough sleep. Also, it's important to increase the weight as you get stronger to continue challenging your muscles. \n\nPlease consult with a fitness professional to ensure these exercises are suitable for your specific fitness level and goals.\n\nAs for the YouTube video title, here's a suggestion: \"Intermediate Dumbbell Chest Workout: 45-Minute Muscle Gain Plan with Warm-Up, Main Exercises, and Cool-Down - 3 Times a Week\""
